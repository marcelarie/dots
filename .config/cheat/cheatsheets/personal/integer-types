Numeric types
Integer types
The unsigned integer types consist of:

Type	Minimum	Maximum
u8	    0	    2^8-1
u16	    0	    2^16-1
u32	    0	    2^32-1
u64	    0	    2^64-1
u128	0	    2^128-1
The signed two's complement integer types consist of:

Type	Minimum	Maximum
i8	    -(27)	2^7-1
i16	    -(215)	2^15-1
i32	    -(231)	2^31-1
i64	    -(263)	2^63-1
i128	-(2127)	2^127-1

Floating-point types
The IEEE 754-2008 "binary32" and "binary64" floating-point types are f32 and f64, respectively.

Machine-dependent integer types
The usize type is an unsigned integer type with the same number of bits as the platform's 
pointer type. It can represent every memory address in the process.

The isize type is a signed integer type with the same number of bits as the platform's pointer type.
The theoretical upper bound on object and array size is the maximum isize value. This ensures that 
isize can be used to calculate differences between pointers into an object or array and can address 
every byte within an object along with one byte past the end.

usize and isize are at least 16-bits wide.
